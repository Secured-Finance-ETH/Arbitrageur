# Interest Carry-Trade Arbitrageur

Automated token carry swap bot ü§ñ exploits interest rate üí∞ **differentials** 24/7.

Interest Carry-Trade Arbitrageur looks for interest rate differentials between lending/borrowing order pairs on Secured Finance. 
It creates a strategy to maximize interest rate differentials, then executes it by borrowing token X, swapping it, and lending token Y for a higher yield (APR).
